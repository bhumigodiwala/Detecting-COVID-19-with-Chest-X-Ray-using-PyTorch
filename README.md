# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray-using-PyTorch

In this project, we use PyTorch to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. The dtaset comprises of nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. Our aim is to create an image classification model to predict Chest X-Ray scans  that belong to one of the above mentioned classes with a reasonably high accuracy.

 **ResNet-18 model**

 ResNet-18 is a 18 layers deep convolutional neural network. A pretrained network can be loaded using PyTorch to train on more than a million image from the ImageNet database.
